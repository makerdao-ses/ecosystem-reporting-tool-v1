# Budget Tool

The budget tool helps to make MakerDAO's expenses transparent across the ecosystem.

MakerDAO Budget Tool creates budget statement summaries from Core Units' personal accounting sheets, pushes them to API so the data can be consumed at <https://expenses.makerdao.network/> by the overall DAO and interested parties.
